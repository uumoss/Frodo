Entries
=======

##Objectives
Learn basics of a custom model object used for data storage, and a singleton controller to manage that those objects.

##Part 1:

###Step 1: Create an EntryController Object
- Create an EntryController with property:
  - Entries (NSArray strong, readonly)
- And methods:
  - + (EntryController *)sharedInstance
  - - (void)addEntry:(Entry *)entry
  - - (void)removeEntry:(Entry *)entry
  - - (void)replaceEntry:(NSDictionary *)oldEntry withEntry:(NSDictionary *)newEntry
  
The shared instance method should be defined to match the gist here:

The addEntry method needs to create a mutable version of the controller's entries array, add the entry that's passed in, and then re-set the controller's Entries array.

The removeEntry method needs to do the reverse. It should create a mutable copy of the entries array, remove the entry that was passed in, and then re-set the controllers Entries array.

The replaceEntry method needs to find the index of the oldEntry and replace it if it exists. It should create a mutable copy of the entries array, check to see if it contains oldEntry, and then if it does find the index and replace object at index.

###Step 2: Update the controller to store the dictionary Entries to NSUserDefaults
- Add a method 'loadFromDefaults'
  - Add a static string for the entryListKey
  - Get an arry "entryDictionaries" from NSUserDefaults for the entryListKey
  - Set self.entries to entryDictionaries
  - Call loadFromDefaults in the sharedInstance method
- Add a method 'synchronize'
  - Save self.entries to NSUserDefaults for key entryListKey
  - Call this method at the end of addEntry and removeEntry and replaceEntry methods



##Part 2:

###Step 3: Create an Entry Object
- Create an Entry with properties:
  - Title (NSString strong)
  - Note (NSString strong)
  - Timestamp (NSDate strong)

###Step 4: Add Dictionary Representations of Entries
- Add two methods to the header of Entry
  - -(NSDictionary *)entryDictionary
  - -(id)initWithDictionary:(NSDictionary *)dictionary
- Add the methods to the implementation file
- Add a const key for each of the properties (i.e. titleKey, flagKey)
- In the dictionary method create a mutable dictionary and then add each of the properties for their key
  - Note: You can't insert a nil object. So you'll want to check those objects before you add them
  - if (title != nil) { [dictionary addObject:title forKey:titleKey] }
- In the init method you'll set the properties to the values for keys from the dictionary
